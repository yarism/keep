- Context menus throughout (right-click on branches, commits, files)

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and available in your PATH

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yarism/keep.git
cd keep
npm install
```

### 2. Run in development mode

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Build distributables

```bash
# macOS (.dmg)
npm run dist

# Windows (.exe installer)
npm run dist:win

# Linux (.AppImage)
npm run dist:linux

# All platforms
npm run dist:all
```

Output goes to the `dist/` folder.

## Installing Without Terminal

### macOS

1. Double-click the `.dmg` to mount it
2. Drag **Keep** into your **Applications** folder
3. On first launch, macOS may block it since it's unsigned — right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog

### Windows

1. Run the `.exe` installer from the `dist/` folder
2. Follow the setup wizard
3. Launch Keep from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

### Linux

1. Make the `.AppImage` executable: `chmod +x Keep-*.AppImage`
2. Double-click it or run it from the terminal
